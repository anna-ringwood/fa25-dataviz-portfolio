# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

It was suggested to me to make the whale sightings map interactive, which made sense to me, particularly because the static image I had was quite blurry. Making the interactive map helped me learn how to create another type of visualization in Tableau. I also heeded the advice to make the colors for each whale type the same across visualizations. For what it's worth, I had planned on doing that originally, but the background maps in ArcGIS made it difficult to discern between the blues and greens. Fortunately, in Tableau the map background doesn't preclude one from distinguishing the colors.

I also received feedback to call out certain parts of my story more clearly. When I wrote the first iterations of the text on Shorthand, I treated the exercise more like a blog post, assuming that everyone would have the time to sit down and read each paragraph. I tend to be more verbose than is needed, so it was helpful that someone else flagged what was making my story more difficult to ingest. Thus, I changed the text in my Shorthand a bit to highlight the more important parts.

The most important thing I learned in this process (and really, the whole course) is that getting outside feedback is imperative. Whether you're designing for a highly technical audience or just the general public, it's possible to get too caught up in the details. Seeking the input of others helped me take a step back and consider the big picture.

## The audience

My final audience includes anyone who is close to the ocean and whales in some way. Whether they like boating or seafood or just live near the sea, I wanted to evoke a sense of admiration for all the great things that the ocean and whales bring us. I felt inspired by my interviews in part two, as the four people I interviewed had mixed interests in boats, seafood, and living near the coast. I aimed to produce a story that would speak to all of them, and tailored my final calls to action with this same desire in mind.

I tried to keep central the idea of "the whales help us, so we should help them in return," which is why I chose to begin my story with Scarlett and the way that she (and other whales) keep carbon out of the atmosphere, assisting in the fight against global warming. In addition, for the boaters and coastal dwellers, whales provide a sense of awe when encountered in nature, and for seafood lovers, they keep the food chain and hydrosphere running smoothly. In essence, there are a lot of reasons to appreciate whales which I thought might garner people's attention. Also, I hadn't considered the carbon fact before, so I figured others might find it surprising, which would help them grow interested in my story.

# Final thoughts

I really enjoyed this project, mostly because I got to talk about whales! In all seriousness, I appreciated the challenge of trying to boil a long story down to one minute, and I also felt that I got good exposure to a wide range of visualization tools (Tableau, Datawrapper, keplergl, and even ArcGIS), though I didn't use all of them for my story specifically.

I unfortunately ran into a bit of a time crunch towards the end, so the final Shorthand isn't as polished as I'd like it to be. Mainly, I wish I had more time to look for better data and make additional visualizations to support my story. However, I am thinking that I might keep working on this a little bit over winter break! I hope both to explore more visualization techniques and refine the ideas I've had so far. I got most excited about the whale sighting data, because it seemed like something I wouldn't have been able to access publicly, but fortunately the researchers who maintain the data have made it available for projects like this one.

Overall, this project was a great experience, and I've learned many lessons--big and small--that I will carry with me in my data visualization career.
