# Welcome!
This is my public portfolio with visualizations created for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU! 

# About me
I am in my second and final year of my master's degree at Heinz College at CMU. I am studying public policy and data analytics, with a particular interest in K-12 education policy. My other policy areas of interest are affordable housing and healthcare. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about what you see here or just want to connect!

# What I hope to learn
I'm taking this course because I have witnessed the importance of good data visualizations in conveying messages to stakeholders. I want to refine my design skills and expand my knowledge about visualization practices so that I can craft meaningful figures and, most importantly, *tell the story* of the data.

Once I graduate, I'd like to find work in or adjacent to a public school district working on program evaluation, making sure that the systems we have in place are supporting the next generation as much as possible while looking for areas to improve. I specifically would like to improve education equity in the U.S., because *all students* deserve a high-quality public education.

# Portfolio

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](dataviz-examples)

The goal of this assignment was to take data and derive a story from it. The data were diverse and conducive to developing several stories, so this was a first pass at parsing out which pieces of the story I wanted to tell.

## Assignment: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)

The goal of this assignment was to redesign an existing visualization and practice soliciting feedback from others.

## Final project

For my final project, I explored the impact that human behaviors (e.g., boating/shipping, fishing, consuming seafood, etc.) have on oceans and their inhabitants. Specifically, I focused on the West Coast of the United States (i.e., Northeast Pacific Ocean) and collected data on whale sightings, reports of dead or distressed whales, shipping patterns, and fishing stocks. I described some of the interactions between humans and whales in the ocean, and concluded with a series of recommendations for boaters, coastal dwellers, and seafood consumers on how they can help protect whales and their habitat.

[Part I](final-project-part-one) involved brainstorming the "story" that I hoped to tell with the data I had found. This part includes some rough sketches of ideas for visualizations.

[Part II](final-project-part-two) involved turning my sketches into quality visualizations and showing them to my intended audience for their feedback. I also further hashed out my storyline.

[Part III](final-project-part-three) involved refining the visualizations and storyline to create the [finished product](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/an-oceanic-tail/index.html).
