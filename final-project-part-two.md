# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

For my draft wireframes and storyboard, see this link (coming soon!).

# User research 

## Target audience

To identify representative individuals, I will ask probing questions before demonstrating my visualizations (e.g., "Do you know a lot about ocean conservation? Would you like to learn more?"). I hope to reach people who are interested in environmental topics but who may not have a lot of prior knowledge. I hope that my story will motivate those who hear/view it to think more deeply about the impact of human behavior on animals and our shared environment, ultimately eliciting a sense of appreciation for whales and a desire to protect their habitat.

## Interview script
My goals in interviewing others are the following:
* Determine whether the visualizations are low-effort to comprehend by my target audience
* Understand how my use of color might be improved, either for clarifying the story or for increasing aesthetics
* Understand how my textual elements might help enhance the visualizations
* Accommodate a wide range of personal tendencies and preferences when it comes to understanding the visualizations

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Determine whether the visualizations are low-effort to comprehend by my target audience|What is this viz trying to convey?<br><br>How quickly did you understand what this viz is trying to show you?|
|Understand how my use of color might be improved, either for clarifying the story or for increasing aesthetics|Do the colors help you understand the viz, or are they distracting?<br><br>If the viz had more, less, or different colors, would you still be able to comprehend it?|
|Understand how my textual elements might help enhance the visualizations|Does the provided text help you understand the viz?<br><br>Do you think anything should be worded differently, added, or removed?|
|Accommodate a wide range of personal tendencies and preferences when it comes to understanding the visualizations|Is there anything about this visualization that you don't like or would change?<br><br>Do you have any other final thoughts?|

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.
