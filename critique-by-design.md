# Critique by Design: U.S. Gun Exports

The goal of this assignment is to select a visualization that has already been created, critique its strengths and weaknesses, and redesign it in an attempt to address the identified weaknesses. The steps below outline the process from selecting the visualization to creating and refining the redesign, with some insights into my thought processes along the way.

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step One: The Visualization

The visualization I chose to redesign is shown below. This one stood out to me due to its unique arrangement, but my initial thoughts were that the overall message is clouded by the chaos of the radial lines. A more in-depth critique is in Step Two.

## Step Two: The Critique

## Step Three, Part One: Sketch a Solution

| Bar Graph | Treemap |
|----------|-------------|
|<img src="images/CritiqueByDesignBarGraphV1.jpg" width="500" />|<img src="images/CritiqueByDesignTreemapV1.jpg" width="500" />|

## Step Four, Part One: Test the Solution

For this part, I asked some classmates to review my two options. Their feedback is below.

**Bar Chart Results:**

| Question | Interview (three M.S. students at CMU, collectively) |
|----------|-------------|
|What do you think this graph is trying to show you?|             |
|What is confusing or what don't you like about this graph?|The percentages don't mean much without more context|
|Other thoughts?||

**Treemap Results:**

|Question|Interview (three M.S. students at CMU, collectively)|
|----------|-------------|
|What do you think this graph is trying to show you?|             |
|What is confusing or what don't you like about this graph?|Having the percentages on the blocks instead of numbers would be more intuitive, since they represent parts of a whole|
|          |             |

## Step Three, Part Two: Sketch a Solution

I incorporated the feedback about the numbers vs. percentages from my classmates to create a new set of sketches:

| Bar Graph | Treemap |
|----------|-------------|
|<img src="images/CritiqueByDesignBarGraphV2.jpg" width="500" />|<img src="images/CritiqueByDesignTreemapV2.jpg" width="500" />|

## Step Four, Part Two: Test the Solution

For this part, I asked some people who are less data-savvy (excluding the AP Stats teacher) to review my two options. Their feedback from my interviews (~10 minutes each) is below. The males were given the bar graph first to look at, then the treemap. The females saw the treemap first, then the bar graph. (It's certainly not the most perfect randomization strategy.)

**Bar Chart Results:**

| Question |Interview 1 (late-50s male, music librarian)|Interview 2 (early-50s female, AP Statistics teacher)|Interview 3 (early-20s female, undergraduate junior)|Interview 4 (early-20s male, engineer)|
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|What do you think this graph is trying to show you?|"To which countries the U.S. has exported semi-automatic firearms, and they are ranked in descending order."|*Did not provide a direct answer*|*Did not provide a direct answer*|"I see Thailand is purchasing a bunch of firearms."|
|What is confusing or what would you change about this graph?|What do the different colors mean? They do reinforce the descending nature of the data, but one would expect to see a legend defining the colors.|Use of 'cumulative' in the x-axis label makes it sound like the countries should be added together|Liked the numbers over the percents|
|Other thoughts?|Liked the counts placed at the ends of the bars|Colors don't bother her as much because they are colored by quintile|Prefers this one to the treemap| |

**Treemap Results:**

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|What do you think this graph is trying to show you?|             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?



Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step Five: Build the Solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._

## AI Acknowledgements
AI was used briefly to help me with some more advanced Tableau features as I experimented (e.g., adding a reference line to the bar chart), but ultimately none of the final results made it to this page because I found that they added too much complexity.
